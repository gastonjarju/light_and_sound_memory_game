## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[No external sources used]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The challenge I had was the button sound. It was not playing the sound and the sequence was not correct. Thus, to resolve this issue, I first increased the button volume to see if was the issue, which was not. Then, I went back to the index.html file to revisit the mouseup and mousedown pats, which was the main issue because my code was not arranged in the correct sequence.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Is there any best IDE to code for web development or it is all about preferences?
What skills does a web developer must possess?
Is it best to master one programming language for developing webs or you have to know a variety?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Add a timer between when the game stops the sequence and when the user has to redo the pattern.
Change the game's background using an image.
Add more buttons to the game.]
